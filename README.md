# Pokedex

## Background

The 2020 version of CS50x has multiple tracks, including web, Android, iOS, and games. I originally completed the web track for CS50x, but I was interested in trying Android development.

This Pokedex application was my first Android project, and one that took a lot of prerequisite work in learning Java, as well as Android Studio.

The original requirements for the Pokedex can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/mobile/android/pokedex/).

## Extra Mile

One feature that I added to go the "extra mile" was to add a Pokeball icon next to a Pokemon in the list of Pokemon if it was already "captured" by the user.
